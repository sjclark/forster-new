title: 'Making New Zealand Accessible'
subtitle: 'A design for effective accessibility legislation'
introduction: 'In a ground-breaking report from 2021 the research team of Warren Forster, Tom Barraclough and Curtis Barnes set out to design legislation that would be effective in identifying and removing barriers that cause disabling experiences for so many of our people. They recognise that this is a once in a generation opportunity for our law and policy makers to develop a regulatory system to bring about this change.'

      <p>Project lead, Warren Forster, says, “We tried to understand the 
      United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
      the ambitions of the Access Alliance and Te Tirirti o Waitangi to create
       a legislative framework that would work within New Zealand’s particular
       legal system. We recognise that we don’t have access to the 
      information, expertise and resourcing available to government.</p><p>“This report also aims to assist disabled people, political leaders, 
      and future decision makers to understand how a system could be designed 
      to provide accessible, equitable and effective change.”</p><p>This report provides a starting point for co-designing the future 
      accessibility system in a way that is most likely to remove known and 
      emerging barriers faced by disabled people and others. It sets out the 
      organisational structures that could be developed to create this. To 
      make this system work, it will need disabled people, iwi groups, 
      businesses, governments, and non-government organisations to collaborate
       to bring about this change.</p><p>While some deviation from the key features incorporated in our system
       is inevitable, any deviations from the key features of the system as we
       have framed it should take into account the reasons we give for why the
       system should be designed in that way.</p><p>The project team has set out the specifics of the system as much as 
      they can and hope it is helpful for people wishing to develop 
      legislation now and continue to be useful for future advocates of 
      accessibility legislation for New Zealand. They have written a report 
      that proposes a legal framework to make New Zealand accessible for and 
      remove barriers that create disabling experiences. A quarter of New 
      Zealanders experience disability, and everyone will have an impairment 
      at some point.</p><p>This document proposes:</p><ul><li>having disabled people play a key role in identifying and removing barriers</li><li>giving people who may have to remove barriers a chance to comment</li><li>giving disabled people and those who would need to comply with the framework a chance to discuss how the law should work.</li></ul><p>The report recommendations aim to get rid of disabling experiences, 
      not get rid of disability. There is nothing wrong with disability or 
      being disabled – disability can be a strong and positive part of 
      someone’s identity.</p><p>The authors encourage readers to discuss their proposal with your whanau and friends, and consider if you support it.</p>
