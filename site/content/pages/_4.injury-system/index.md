<p>We have a complex system in New Zealand where injured people get the assistance they need from ACC and a range of other agencies. ACC's current role is focused on whether a person's need for assistance is caused by a "covered injury". </p><p>New Zealand also has many different agencies that investigate what caused the injury, regardless of whether it's covered. Each of these agencies has a different process and investigates different things. </p><p>Learn about our proposal to reform this personal injury system to make it more accessible and to work better for people.&nbsp;</p>
