title: 'Removing Disabling Experiences'
subtitle: 'A vision for the future of our people'
introduction: |
  People are the heart of our communities and our society in Aotearoa, New Zealand.  We recognise as a society that many people with impairments have disabling experiences; these can result in exclusion, and we want to change that. We share a vision that in the future we will have an integrated person-directed system for supporting people with impairments that will reduce our disabling experiences. This future system will provide four enforceable rights to social and income support, habilitation, and healthcare. 
  
  It will coordinate with two complementary systems for improving accessibility and for removing discrimination through an organisation that is tasked with removing peoples' negative disabling experiences.

      <h3><b>Four enforceable rights of the proposed future system</b></h3><p>This is a proposed new system proposed to create enforceable rights for persons with impairments to personalised social support, income support, habilitation,
      and healthcare. Creating this new system will meet the principles of the
      Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, empower people to live
      their best life, and increase choice and control. These would be provided by the
      state through a centralised administrative system for people with impairment, similar
      to the way entitlements are currently available under the ACC system. This includes modifications,
      adjustments and supports for a person with impairment, to ensure their
      enjoyment or exercise of all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal
      basis with others.</p><p>These are all existing rights that should already be
      provided through a “rights based” framework. But disabled people know that these are not enforceable, not
      effective and are not provided in a person-centric manner, let alone
      person-directed. This work focuses primarily on developing a system to
      create enforceable rights, and then a roadmap to implement this system over the next
      decade. Whilst the system of enforceable rights has an important role to play
      in removing disabling experiences, the future system will not be able to remove
      many of the <a href="https://forster.co.nz/accessibility-report" target="_blank">wider systemic barriers</a> and it will not stop discrimination. The future system will work alongside the accessibility system and anti-discrimiation system. <br></p><h3><b>Six Guiding Principles</b><br></h3><p>As we create the future system we will be informed by six guiding principles. The future system must:<br></p><ul><li>meet the requirements of Te Tiriti o
      Waitangi, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and the
      Human Rights frameworks that we have committed to</li></ul><ul><li>deliver integrated, person-directed legally
      enforceable rights with a person-centred dispute resolution pathway</li></ul><ul><li>innovate
      the funding model to ensure sustainability and equity for current and future
      generations</li></ul><ul><li>progressively realise the vision of
      the future system through a planned approach over time</li></ul><ul><li>improve the health and safety of
      communities through creating an evidence-based system and investment in
      communities </li></ul><ul><li>provide oversight and coordination between
      this system, the barrier identification and removal system <a href="https://forster.co.nz/accessibility-report" target="_blank">(accessibility)</a>, the
      <a href="https://www.hrc.co.nz/how-we-can-help/" target="_blank">anti-discrimination system</a> and the wider health and social systems.</li></ul><h3><b>Read the full report here: </b><br></h3>
