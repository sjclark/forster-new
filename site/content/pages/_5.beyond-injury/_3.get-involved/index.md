  The ACC Minister Iain Lees-Galloway has specifically asked to hear what you have to say about the current system: 
  
  "I have said I would welcome the public's response to this. However, so far the evidence I have to gauge this response is the Stuff poll and the sum total of three emails received on this issue … So I do not believe that we have had a sufficient public response yet on this matter."
