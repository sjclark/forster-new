media_blurb: 'An ACC expert says Kiwis suffering Complex Regional Pain Syndrome are slipping through the cracks of bureaucratic red tape. Dunedin barrister and researcher Warren Forster says ACC is letting down patients with the syndrome, said to be the world''s most painful. Forster says ACC case managers saw CRPS sufferers as "easy targets" to decline cover to because of differences in opinion from assessing doctors over how the syndrome occurs.'
