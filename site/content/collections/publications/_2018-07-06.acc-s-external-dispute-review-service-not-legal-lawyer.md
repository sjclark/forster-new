media_blurb: 'A lawyer representing ACC claimants says the corporation has been acting illegally by contracting out its dispute resolution services to a private company. Dunedin barrister Warren Forster says this calls into question thousands of cases where people have lost a dispute over their claim. The Accident Compensation Corporation contracts the private company Fairway to resolve disputed claims but Mr Forster says they don''t have the legal authority to do so.'
