media_blurb: 'New Zealand could become the first nation to comply with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, but no country has yet made the "necessary changes". That comment came yesterday from Dunedin lawyer and ACC researcher Warren Forster in a  talk given on the last day of a national "disability matters" conference in Dunedin. A UN committee monitoring compliance with the convention had earlier urged New Zealand to adopt a human rights approach to ACC-related access to justice issues, and recommended that we "make steps to change", Mr Forster said.'
