media_blurb: 'ACC is seeking legal advice on whether it should be covering claims filed after the Havelock North gastro outbreak. A spokesman said the corporation had identified five claims relating to the campylobacter outbreak in August last year. "Four were declined, and one accepted because it was for a physical injury to someone with the gastro bug," he said.'
