media_blurb: 'Claimant support group Acclaim Otago is "disappointed and frustrated" with the latest restructuring of ACC’s community liaison committees and will no longer take part. Acclaim spokeswoman Dr Denise Powell has represented Acclaim on the committees for 13 years, most recently as a member of ACC’s advocates and representatives group (ARG), since 2012. Restructuring ARG was "a slap in the face", given that a review report by consultants Martin Jenkins suggested ARG had not been "timely or productive".'
