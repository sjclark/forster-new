media_blurb: 'A new Ministry for Disabled People will improve the “broken" disability system and the lives of the one in four New Zealanders who have a disability, the Government says. The new ministry, which will come into existence in July next year, will pull policy together from various ministries. Strengthening the mandate and resourcing of public leadership for the disability community was a Labour 2020 election manifesto commitment. Minister for Social Development Carmel Sepuloni said on Friday the disability system was “broken and puts too many barriers in place for disabled people and whānau”.'
