media_blurb: 'The Accident Compensation Corporation is paying out much more to men than to women. Huge disparities in the number of claims for sports and work-related injuries and motor vehicle accidents meant only about 37 per cent of the payouts made by ACC went to women last year, with 63 per cent going to men. But women are also more likely to have many types of claim turned down.'
