media_blurb: 'Tens of thousands of "blank template" letters have been left out of ACC''s official reporting on how many claims it approves or declines. Barrister Warren Forster, who has represented hundreds of ACC claimants, said in his experience the "CM03" documents were like "blank cheque" letters, often used by ACC staff to decline claims for cover and entitlements. ACC said the letters could not be retrieved as it "would require ACC to undertake an extensive manual search through all claim files", but the agency was confident only a small number were used to decline claims. Forster said it was "disturbing" a large government agency had such a significant gap in data, when that information was used for statistical modelling to manage claims.'
