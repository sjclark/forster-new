  A crack team of specialists at health insurer Southern Cross is forcing ACC to reverse decisions to decline cover for surgery. There's a fresh focus on how hard it is for injured people to challenge ACC when it declines a claim with the release of the Solving the Problem report, and outspoken comments from former prime minister Geoffrey Palmer. Southern Cross set up its team a decade ago because it believed ACC was wrongly turning down legitimate claims by policyholders, leaving the health insurer to pay the cost of treating them.
