media_blurb: 'The excellent work of recent IRF recipients suggests they will continue the established trend. Last year’s winner, Warren Forster, has taken on nothing less than a fundamental “world first” conceptual rethink of how we organise and fund health and disability services. His early ideas are attracting considerable interest from policy-makers, and offer the prospect of improved access to quality care for many who struggle to navigate the system.'
