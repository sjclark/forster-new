media_blurb: 'An ACC claimant who signed over every cent of her backdated payout to an advocate says the Government should provide free legal support services. Christchurch woman Natasha Howell, 44, was awarded $84,797 in compensation in a settlement with ACC after her weekly payments were cancelled. Howell suffers from severe pain related to spinal surgeries. She had signed a contract handing over any backdated compensation to an "accident compensation law specialist" in June 2017 to help her challenge ACC''s decision to cancel her payments.'
