media_blurb: 'ACC is biased against women, Māori and Pasifika, a new analysis shows. Women are less likely to make ACC claims, more likely to be declined when they do, and they receive far less compensation than men, the figures show. Over the past five years it has become even harder for women - especially Māori and Pasifika women - to get an ACC claim accepted. The decline rate for women has increased from 2.2 to 2.6 percent. In comparison, the decline rate for men only increased from 1.9 to 2.1 percent. If women did get cover and were entitled to weekly compensation payments, they got a little over half the rate of men.'
