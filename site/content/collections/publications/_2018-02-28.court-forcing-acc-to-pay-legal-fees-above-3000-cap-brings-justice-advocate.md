media_blurb: 'A "game changing" court decision to make ACC pay legal costs above a $3000 cap is a major victory for justice, an ACC advocate says. The Crown entity was required to pay a maximum of $3000 in legal costs for cases it loses, irrespective of the actual fee incurred, since a ruling in 2008. But a new ruling from District Court Judge Grant Powell orders ACC to pay $7500 of one successful claimant''s $8800 costs. The cap had been a huge barrier to justice for claimants, ACC barrister and researcher Warren Forster said. '
