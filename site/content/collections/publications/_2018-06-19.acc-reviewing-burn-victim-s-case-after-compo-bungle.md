media_blurb: 'ACC has told a burns victim he''s only entitled to half the compensation he expected while off work recovering from reconstructive surgery because he was a child and wasn''t working when he was burned. A lawyer who specialises in ACC claims says the man should be entitled to full compensation. The lawyer believes thousands of people, including hundreds who were sexually abused as children, are likely to be in the same situation and is calling for a law change.'
