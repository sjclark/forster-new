media_blurb: 'Public insurer ACC is using a secret computer model to predict how long clients will be on its books, then sorting and targeting those it considers a risk. The software was built using the private information of thousands of ACC clients without their knowledge - and possibly without their consent. It has had no public scrutiny or oversight from agencies such as the Privacy Commissioner, despite having potential mass privacy implications.'
