message: "Dear Warren Forster,\r\n\r\nI have just been reading an article about what you have presented to ACC, and would like to say thank you for everything that you are doing to challenge ACC&rsquo;s decision process.\r\nWith all due respect, watching all the advertisements about mental health issues and ACC advertising in NZ isn&rsquo;t that great from my perspective, and quite honestly I&rsquo;ve found it is a joke. \r\nLet me share my story with you so I can explain why I feel this way.\r\n\r\nMy current GP still has myself diagnosed as having Severe Post-Concussion Syndrome (PCS). I also still have whiplash injuries listed with ACC from this initial accident with no access to treatment allocation for my injuries.\r\n\r\nIt has now been over 4 years since my motor vehicle accident, where I sustained double concussion and whiplash injuries from hitting a Sheep on the road.\r\nTravelling to work at Fonterra Edendale, on the morning of 29/6/18, I hit a sheep in the dark on the road, driving to work in the early hours of the morning travelling at 100 kph and ended up in a ditch. Four Sheep ran across the road in front of me, running out from behind the bridge armco barrier where I hit the last sheep running across the road in front of me.\r\nPolice weren't called initially after the incident as there was no cell phone coverage where the accident occurred, this accident was logged with them afterwards once I had obtained cell phone coverage, I was helped out of the ditch by a passing motorist.\r\nThis accident happened on a Friday morning, once managing to drive home in shock, I was driven to the Invercargill Kew St Hospital. Whilst visiting the Emergency Department (ED) in Invercargill for approx 10-15 minutes, I was told by the ED physician that I could return to work on the following Monday. With the headaches that were continuing throughout the weekend I was seen by my GP in Otautau, Southland and was given the week off work by him. Towards the end of this week my headaches became so bad that I spent a night at the ED in Invercargill. I was given a CT scan during this stay. I then had X-rays approx 2 weeks after my accident organised by my then GP.\r\n\r\nOverall this was about my 6th concussion from memory, the previous concussions were from rugby and mountain biking, over a space of approximately 30 years and I have no medical history of these events as concussion was never talked about in NZ. Since my MVA (Motor vehicle accident) on the 29/6/18, I have had ongoing medical symptoms that have never gone away and some symptoms that have never been investigated. I still have excruciating headaches on a daily basis with no medication that works. I have constant Dizziness, Vestibular issues, Fatigue, Irritability, Anxiety, Insomnia, Loss of concentration and memory, High pitched Ringing in both ears, Blurry vision, Noise and light sensitivity and decreases in taste and smell.\r\nThe constant high pitched ringing in both my ears has never been investigated, sleep is pretty much a non event every night, I only manage a few hours sleep each night and/or it&rsquo;s not uncommon for me to be awake for days on end, this also has not been investigated. I&rsquo;ve tried numerous medications for sleeping, headaches and other symptoms but nothing seems to work to reduce any pain or symptoms that I currently have. I am currently taking 70mg of Venlafaxine, 30 mg of Nortriptyline and Omeprazole daily.\r\n\r\nMy vision has also been impaired by this accident as I now need to wear glasses fitted with Irlens Bifocal Prism lenses to correct my vision, especially in my right eye. These glasses were initially provided by ACC and I was also provided by ACC with Silicon moulded ear plugs which I had used for work, and still\r\ncurrently use at home. I have just had to upgrade my glasses recently at my cost $2000, as my vision continues to deteriorate with these same original symptoms.\r\n\r\nI did an ACC rehabilitation program for 9 months after this accident happened with ACC and APM Invercargill when I was still living in Winton, Southland. It had taken the best part of a year for me to be able to start returning to work. I have lost count how many times it has taken me, where I have had to stop working because of these ongoing symptoms, trying to return to work from this initial accident.\r\nOn returning to full time work I was informed by my then manager at where I was working at the time of my accident, that if I was to return to full time work, working for them, that there was no plan B for me to return to work in another role within this company.\r\nI was still struggling with all the physical and mental attributes with my job as a Field Service Technician even though I had shown APM that I could do a small service job, I wasn't comfortable working in this type of environment with my ongoing symptoms whilst trying to prove that I could return to this type of work. I had been working in Dairy factories all over NZ with preventative and maintenance tasks and felt this was very unsafe for myself to be working alone and for others around me to continue working in this environment.\r\nMy Service Dept had organised for me to travel to Hokitika for approx 8 weeks, working 12-14 hours a day, 6 days a week, to perform these maintenance tasks. We were moving into our busy season of the year where all the maintenance is carried out over a few months whilst these milk factories are completely shut down during the off season for milk products. I was programmed in for more maintenance work once this job had been completed in Hokitika for approximately another 3/4 months of service work to be carried out away from home in other areas of the country.\r\n\r\nI had only been working on recording the electronic data from the daily records of these machines to plan our winter maintenance. These machines can only be worked on with time restraints because of when they can be shut down for yearly programmed maintenance. I had only completed one of these machines maintenance tasks with the Occupational Therapist (APM) with 2 other work peers once, and it was expected of me to be able to perform these tasks daily for this interim of time away from home in Hokitika and other companies across NZ.\r\n\r\nI had not long returned to full hours still working under ACC and I did not feel I could continue with this unrealistic goal and thought it was unsafe to be working 700 km away from home trying to achieve this goal with my ongoing symptoms that wouldn't resolve themselves. Because I was still under ACC (I had been in contact with a Job recruitment company) no other company would look at employing me in a different role because of my ongoing symptoms under ACC. I felt like I was being forced into making a decision and I felt this was quite unfair, considering what was happening and what was being asked of me to perform. I did not want to leave TPNZ.\r\n\r\nI had been in contact with a previous employer in Matamata, Waikato, North Island, NZ who said that they would take me on in an engineering sales role, hence why I felt I had to leave my Service role at TPNZ.\r\nI didn't feel comfortable trying to achieve these physical and mental return to work goals and felt nobody was listening to my concerns. I lasted about 4 months in my new sales role working full time based in Matamata, before I relapsed again and haven&rsquo;t been able to return to work since because of my ongoing symptoms.\r\n\r\nWhilst I was working in my sales role, I ended up travelling all over NZ away from home. I was also asked to help assemble numerous 6m long sections of Conveyor Stringer frames together for a customer as we didnt have enough engineering staff to complete this job before transporting these frames to site. I struggled with this daily as it only flared my symptoms up further, I couldn't work on my back looking up as it was putting too much pressure on my upper body. I was also riding my mountain\r\nbike around town, taking short runs/walks and playing squash to try and regain my fitness. All these activities I am now unable to do.\r\n\r\nI was also in charge of moving our entire engineering shop in Matamata which is something further I was also struggling with, and I wasn't expecting to do. I was moving tons of engineering equipment to their new premises and removing tons of old paper documentation into waste bins from a second storey storage loft. I was again struggling to deal with these work conditions but carried on the best way I could. I had to relocate to the North Island and move away from home and family to be able to continue to work, during this time my marriage also failed, and my Nana passed away.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't long after I had stopped working in Matamata that I had a Colonoscopy examination at Waikato Hospital because of the amount of blood in my stool. The result of this examination was because of the amount of painkillers that I was taking, which was having a major problem with my stomach lining, I also had to have a Double Inguinal Hernia operation performed at Thames Hospital. I had spent approx 3 weeks in bed over 2019 Xmas and I didn't want to go to the Dr and report these ongoing symptoms again as I felt that I had failed, again. I had been trying to work with these ongoing symptoms again, and again with very little to no sleep, headaches etc trying to work as normal. I had been told that this was the best way forward by my old GP, to continue working.\r\n\r\nBecause of Covid 19 in NZ, there haven't been many opportunities for me to make any appointments to challenge this decision or get a diagnosis with anything that I still currently have. I have been waiting over 2 years for a review with ACC, I&rsquo;m now 46 years old and It&rsquo;s been over 2 1/2 years since I had to stop working, again. In April 2021, I was informed by ACC that after careful consideration they can no longer help or assist me with my injuries from this initial 2018 incident.\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;ve only received financial assistance from ACC for a short period of time since moving and a few Neurological appointments completed organised by ACC.\r\nI had to personally chase up the neurologist for my initial results, this had taken myself over 3 months to acquire. He had spoken about injections in my neck to reduce my symptoms at this appointment because of what he had found. My ACC case manager had asked me to chase him up as they&rsquo;d heard nothing from him also during this time, I finally got a report to say that I was depressed. By this time ACC had received this report, ACC discredited his findings from his report because of the length of time taken to\r\nrespond.\r\n\r\nThe second neurologist that ACC had organised for me reported accordingly with many mistakes, incorrect information and many indescrepencies. This neurologist that I saw, reported that my answers were too inconsistent for her test report. This was a 4 hour neurological test session with her and 5 hours of travel, with my partner driving over 300 km. ACC based their final decision on this report with my old GP also agreeing with this report without my prior knowledge.\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;ve been organising my own physio during this time to try and keep on top of everything with my ongoing headaches, neck/back issues. Also during this time my old GP had his medical license suspended leaving me with more questions than answers as I don't know why he has lost his license, and sold his practice.\r\n\r\nOver the last 4 years I have continuously been seeing all types of physiotherapists with my neck injuries with very little to no progress. I&rsquo;ve recently been working with Align Health in Cambridge and have had some good results from the Watson Technique physiotherapy, working on my C1,2,3 vertebrae. I have also recently found out that my neck vertebrae are still twisted out of place and this is not able to be picked up on a MRI. Through seeing a Pain Doctor in Rotorua it is highly possible that I have Facet Joint Syndrome that nobody has taken the time to look into. I now have two appointments booked in Rotorua for private treatment for nerve blockers to be injected in my neck to help reduce the Back and neck pain, The cost of these appointments is around 10K. Even though I still have Whiplash injuries listed with ACC from this initial accident, ACC won't look at the new diagnosis until it is listed with them as a new injury, my current GP will not list this with ACC as a new diagnosis as I still have whiplash injuries listed with ACC but with no allocation towards treatments.\r\n\r\nMy last payment from ACC was on 25/5/21, I also don&rsquo;t qualify for any other help or assistance from any other Govt agency, WINZ or my personal insurance options that I have.\r\nI have written for help to the current Minister of ACC and associate Minister, National ACC Spokesman, my local area MP, NZ Medical Ombudsman, WINZ, IRD (personal debt wiped) Kiwisaver (account now closed to pay for personal debt and divorce), Westpac (my personal insurer) NZ Health &amp; Disability Commissioner, NZ Human Rights Commissioner (waiting for a response) and have been told by all of them that they can't intervene in a current ACC case review or that I don't qualify for any help or assistance. \r\nI&rsquo;ve had my personal debt wiped this year with IRD, and I have been left with no personal income entitlements. I had personal debt to pay after my relationship with my wife had failed and I have no more personal assets left to sell. I was recently able to acquire my Kiwisaver in full to pay off all my personal debt. This decision from ACC leaves me financially with no means to be able to investigate this further as to why I still have all these symptoms with no medical explanation or support as to why these symptoms are still continuing 4 1/2years after my initial accident.\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;ve now been waiting over 2 years now for a review with ACC with no financial assistance or support from any government agency. ACC says that because I returned to full time work, not by choice I might add, I had to move from Southland to Waikato to survive as I felt that ACC was setting me up to fail completely and has never taken my injuries seriously, even more so once I had to move.\r\nMy two children still live in Southland, living with their mother aged 10 &amp; 12, I no longer have regular contact with them because of my health issues and the unavailability to earn a wage or receive any financial assistance, absolutely nothing, zero. \r\nI was kicked off ACC during the first Covid pandemic in NZ and since then I have not been able to obtain any further help or support with my ongoing symptoms also because of my partner's income. She has also lost her father in the last year to Prostate Cancer and is also finalising her divorce but none of this is able to be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance,\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\nAndy Leadbeater"
