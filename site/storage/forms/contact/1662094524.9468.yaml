message: "Hi Warren\r\n\r\nI just wanted to connect and say it was great to meet you at the NZLF dinner.  I have just been having a  look at your recent reports  - you are doing amazing work that promises to make a real difference for people.     I have to say though - I am still getting my head around your work routine!  But I guess it explains how you manage to keep all those projects going.  \r\n\r\n It would be great to catch up with you in the future when I am in Wellington.\r\n\r\nTake care,\r\nJeanne\r\n\r\nAll the best\r\nJeanne"
