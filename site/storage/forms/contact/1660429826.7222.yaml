message: "Kia ora Warren,\r\n\r\nMy name is Olivia (Liv) Redman and I have been seeing your name pop up heaps this week surrounding the issues with ACC. I had an article written about me and another SA survivor this week that you shared on twitter. I still haven't heard back from ACC after the Psychiatrist looking after my case has pushed for me to be better looked after with my disabilities. \r\n\r\nI wondered if you had any recommendations as to what I do to push this further or even be able to talk to someone in parliament? I am even willing to go into detail publicly of what exactly happened to me if this could be of help to get politicians to listen. I am very passionate about the sensitive claims process due to its discriminatory nature, and I want change for other people going through the same thing. I am very tough! :)\r\n\r\nThank you so much for reading and sharing.\r\n\r\nLiv Redman"
