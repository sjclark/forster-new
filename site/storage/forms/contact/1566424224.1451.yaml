message: "Attention: Warren Forster\r\nHi Warren.\r\nI have been given your name by Warrick Loveday, Tuakau Physio, as a recommended person to make representations to ACC regarding a declined injury funding application. \r\nIn simple terms they are saying that two slips on ice in Toronto which tore my Rotator Cuff is a &quot;sprain&quot; which they have covered the costs of but the repair of the tear isnt covered as it is &quot;normal wear and tear&quot;.\r\nCan you please provide me with some insight to what's involved and some likely costs.\r\nThank you in anticipation\r\nIan Litchfield"
