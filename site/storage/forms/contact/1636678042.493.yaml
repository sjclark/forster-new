message: 'I am an executor in New Zealand for my mother''s estate, her partner challenged her estate, we have a settlement however before distribution of the estate I would like the following question answered.  As an executor can I sue her partner for causing injury to me as he was well aware that I am a mental health patient and it could be reasonably be expected to cause further injury due to the prolonged protracted difficult expensive process which he created intentionally.   My condition has now significantly deteriorated and acc will not support me as I live in Australia'
