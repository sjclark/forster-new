message: "Dear Warren,\r\nI have a little question that I am hoping you could help me with please?\r\nIf a person is covered 100% for personal injury by accident, then later discovers the personal injury is a result of medical negligence. Is the person able to obtain more assistance from ACC? \r\nSecondly, I am a little puzzled if ACC has a &quot;no fault&quot; policy, then why is it that children who experience an accident, or anyone who is not working at the time of their accident are penalised in terms of their entitlement / eligibility to assistance from ACC? \r\nI could be wrong but I would have assumed it was a breach of the Human Rights Act to discriminate people in terms of their age and employment status?\r\nI look forward to your reply.\r\nKind regards\r\nTania Lamb"
