message: "Hi Warren Forster\r\n\r\nMy name is Jamie Henderson and I was given your name and contact details by my Aunty (Sharlene Norton) who used to do printing work at Warehouse Stationery when you were based in Dunedin.\r\n\r\nFor over a decade I have been trying to get assistance with a serious injury I had sustained in 2002 which resulted in 2 broken legs and a TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury)  which was subsequently measured to be a 27% reduction in capacity by a neurologist.  At the time ACC was helpful and I was paid an $11k lump sum, and living costs for a time obviously due to the 2 broken legs.\r\n\r\nThen in 2007 I was essentially &quot;kicked to the curb&quot; by somebody at the ISIS (apparently named PRU now for obvious reasons) head injury clinic who interviewed me and labelled my issues as nothing more than simple depression (completely missing the point that of course somebody having trouble controlling their brain would be depressed about it).  I considered this woman to be rather malicious, and she steamrolled me along with my support person present, and ACC subsequently dropped all assistance. Deciding I was vocationally independent.\r\n\r\nI took this as just what it was - and continued with trying to make the best of my situation;  Subsequent years were spent bouncing from job to job as I am a hard worker, but I have not met an employer yet who understands how complex a head injury can affect somebody and thus my employment inevitably leads to a downward spiral along with an exit.  Even with being completely upfront with employers about my head injury, I have never tried to conceal it.  But it always ends the same way.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, the times I do have stable employment I seem to only have enough mental bandwidth available to make one or the other work (work/life) if I do good at my job, then my brain is too exhausted to do life things. And when I turn my attention to fix the life things, the job side falls apart; This has been a repeated cycle for a very long time.\r\n\r\nI did have seizures in the earlier days of my head injury (I have had 7 total, none since mid 2010s) and have been on Clonazepam (the long lasting benzo drug that is an anti-anxiety but is also off label prescribed to treat seizures) which has been a godsend regarding the seizure side of my injury.   As prior to being on that medication I had established a complicated &quot;algorithm&quot; of sorts whereby I could detect seizure signals, and head them off before they occurred.  The three main causes of my seizures were Reading Books (I was an avid bookworm so had to give up reading as it was too dangerous with my seizures),  Group Conversations - I cannot participate in group conversations or inhabit noisy atmospheres, as my brain can't filter it all out - and basically overloads and crashes my brain, hence a seizure. And finally stress, which I find is the hardest one to manage, as stress is unavoidable if you are trying to progress in life.\r\n\r\nAll of this I chose to battle through, thinking I could beat the odds and be some sort of miracle story of somebody who managed some success or a healthy life with such a severe brain injury and have now realised that A: this has not been an effective strategy and B: my head injury has been worsening and evolving over this past decade to the point where I am struggling to manage it again.\r\n\r\nFor the past 10 years I had been painting houses for my father who has been the only employer who actually understood and knew I was a unique employee with unique requirements who was highly susceptible to stress, but this was only a modest living at the time, and diminished to the point where it was no longer financially viable for either myself or my Father.  I then went to a &quot;proper&quot; painting employer in town (Gore is where I reside) and over the course of a 6 month stint painting picked up a sever wrist injury while at home and had to raise another ACC claim to assist with the wrist injury. This injury has not even being diagnosed yet as I have not been referred to a hand specialist or had an MRI scan done, only 2 Xrays to verify that it was not a fracture in order to be able to refer me to the hand specialist.  Now my Dr. is contradicting his earlier treatment plan and is only offering me a steroid injection, which I have no confidence in as without an MRI scan there is no way he will be able to know where the injury site is.\r\n\r\nThe wrist injury is secondary to my main issues but I outline it as it is the main cause for my already fragile mental state - now I am faced with the prospect of possibly having a permanent injury of my right hand wrist, and yes I am right-handed.  This has caused to mental state to deteriorate considerably, as I am now trapped ... I can't do stressful or intellectual work due to my head injury, and my previous go to of being a hard worker is now jeopardized due to a mis-managed wrist injury - this has been accelerating my mental decline, as if I can't to mental work, and can't do physical work - I am very uncertain with what I can do.\r\n\r\nPut bluntly I'm frightened of my future and feel ACC isn't considering this as possibly linked to each other (due to the way they manage claims independently), and also with no Dr.'s hearing any of my repeated pleas that my head injury is worsening is just spiralling me even further.  Until Aunty Sharlene mentioned you, and what you do.  I need somebody who can help me navigate this as it befuddles me that ACC expects somebody who is 27% reduced in mental capacity by their numbers to be able to navigate an effective outcome by themselves, I feel there is a high chance that I will slip through the cracks once again. In regards to that 27% number also I know and believe that it can't be quantified so easily, and Dr's largely have no idea what to do with people with injuries such as mine, I also am certain that % is higher (measured around 2004-5 I think) now.\r\n\r\nA running joke I tell people who I run into who have their own head injuries or to families or friends asking about mine is that you become your own Dr. as each head injury is unique and to be quite frank the treatment for such injuries is non-existent.  I am at that point where my brain is no longer suitable to be it's own Dr. due to a certainty my head injury has evolved and desperately need yours or anybody you can think of assistance to try and navigate this.\r\n\r\nI am sorry this is so long, but this is just an indication of how complex my situation is, and being brain damaged I am just lost and fearful I am going to slip through the cracks or not be able to navigate to an effective resolution adequately.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading, Aunty Sharlene speaks very highly of you - and this is my Hail Mary to try and get somebody in my corner whilst dealing with ACC.   I was assigned a case manager 2 weeks ago who is in the process of digitising my paper records (ACC went digital 2007 - injury 2002) and seems &quot;relatively&quot; receptive to my predicament but is ignoring the fact the wrist injury could be co-related and also the usual ignorance of head injuries,  his name is Brad Dawson.\r\n\r\nAgain thank you, Aunty Sharlene said you may need my NHI number so here it is: EFU5273    you have my full permission to access any and all medical records, or if I need to sign anything in order for you to do so I will be more than happy to oblige.  You can reach me through this email or on my cellphone 022 167 5763.\r\n\r\nThanks and Regards\r\nJamie Henderson"
