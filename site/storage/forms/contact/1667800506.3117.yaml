message: "Hi,\r\nIn 1982 I was severely injured during a peacetime training programme in Waiouru Army Camp. A soldier returned with blind explosives where he detonated the explosives in my vicinity. I am 58 years old and my health physical and mental is my concern. I had made an initial claim not knowing my future with the ACC but I do feel that I was not afforded a true understanding of what would be my future health or mental. By either the Army/Defence force or ACC. I am not eligible for veterans support or a pension or health assessment. I was looking for assistance with guidance to help me out in approaching ACC\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nPhil Koziol"
