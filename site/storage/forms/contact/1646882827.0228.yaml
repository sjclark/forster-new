message: "Dear Warren,\r\nI am not looking for a solicitor to work with me but to give full instructions to a barrister I am hoping to work with. Is this something you could assist me with please?\r\nMy reason for contacting you is because The Community Law Centre informed me I require a solicitor who is familiar with the area of law I am pursuing.\r\nThere are no legal advisors specialising in Personal injury litigation in Palmerston North, as this is your area of expertise, I would appreciate it if you could as mentioned, forward instructions to a Barrister by the name of Mr James Farmer who is situated in Auckland and which I could forward you his email and postal address once I find out if giving a full set of instructions to a Barrister is something you do?\r\nI would be more than happy to send you a synopsis of my case, if you require the details.\r\nAlternatively, if you would prefer, or need further clarification, I could telephone you at a time that is convenient for us both. \r\nPlease let me know what the fee for this would be and I will pay this.\r\nKind regards\r\nTania Lamb"
