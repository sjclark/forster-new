message: "On the 26/01/18 I had booked a morning activity of Shot over Jet and River rafting with &quot;Go Orange&quot; (the company facilitating the activities). I had not signed any disclaimer or waiver of any kind prior to boarding the Shot Over Jet, only an attendance register which all other passengers had signed as well. (a single sheet of paper). I was seated directly behind the driver therefore when the Jet collided head on with the reef I had received full impact, therefore ended up breaking my forearm (the ulna and the radius) on my right arm. I was then taken to the hospital to have my surgery on the 27/01/18 and discharged on 28/01/18. The maritime police took legal action to Go Orange and I am to receive 9000 NZD for compensation for emotional and physical harm. I feel I should be getting more, as the driver was found to be under the influence of drugs &amp; alchohol. https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/119049270/five-injured-after-jetboat-beaches-on-queenstown-river?cid=app-android.\r\n\r\nRegards Anish"
