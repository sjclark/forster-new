I am a 66 year old typical Kiwi DIY home owner.  I used to be able to do any tradesman like job around my home and expected to upto maybe mid to late 70's  Now, I have to pay trade rates of $65. to $95. per hour.  My conservative estimate is that between now and age 78 this will cost in excess of $100,000.\r\nI have inquired from ACC about the fact next year my house needs a complete plaint (routine maintenance), the answer was NO!\r\n\r\nRespectfuly\r\nRobin S McKee\r\n0274 998660"
