message: "Despite having a significant number of accepted claims over the last three decades with the ACC I have never had any form of independent medical assessment for purposes of determining the degree of my disabilities with the consequence that I received no lump sums nor independence allowances. ACC have cancelled my claim for cover and entitlements which included surgery. Nonetheless ACC have acknowledged in court that they are still required by the act to fund independent medical assessment in order to calculate their liabilities. Despite numerous review hearings in my favour resulting in the ACC to carry out these assessments ACC still have not done anything.\r\n\r\nMy injuries are progressively overwhelming me with regards to PTSD combined with having additional injuries resulting from not being able to cope with untreated injuries.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that I am one of many but if I could have some assistance or even guidance that would be appreciated."
