message: "Hi,\r\nOn boxing day  a car seat on my 1996 Toyota Ipsum slammed into my face as I was adjusting the seat back to normal from the lie flat position causing a scar and a lump on my face.\r\n\r\nI car seat hit me with a huge force and would have broken my nose if it had hit there. There was heaps of blood and pain and now a permanent mark. Is there any recourse for me as I don't like the mark on my face and I think there is a fault with these seats?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nChris"
