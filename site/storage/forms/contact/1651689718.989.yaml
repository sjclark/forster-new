message: "Hi, i'm contacting you to request help with acc in regards to the minimal amount of benefit that I am receiving.  I have been given advice from an ACC employer that I can challenge the amount I receive due to loss of potential earnings.\r\nIn 2008,  I was working for the logistics company Fliways as a driver assistant.  Ever since I can remember, from a very young age I wanted a career in the transport industry operating large vehicles, trucks, Cranes, Diggers  etc and when employed with Fliways I finally  was on the right career pathway.  Due to the workplace injury I sustained, only one month after starting my employment - this resulted with me becoming an Asia A Complete tetraplegic and permanently bound to a wheelchair.  I was 18 years old and in need of 24/7 care for the rest of my life.\r\nThe company pleaded guilty in court to negligence and were ordered to pay a fine of $60,000 to authorities and I received $120,000 as compensation. I also recieved a lump sum compensation payment for emotional and physical harm from acc of $120,000.I was only 18 years old at the time of  my injury and was on the minimum wage $12.50 an hour. Acc pay  80% of what I earnt and my weekly wage comes to $520 after tax.\r\nThis amount of money is simply not enough for me to live on and for me to provide for myself and my family.\r\nI was 18 years of age, was working over 60 hours each week. If Id worked a 40 hour week , my situation would be so much worse. My goal was obvious and I was a hard worker and my career pathway was full steam ahead.\r\nI now find that my dreams of working in the transport industry is unobtainable - Instead I am always reliant upon my family members being employed by the caregiving agency , who are the ones who provide my cares.\r\nI've tried starting my own online business selling merchandise but the multiple medications im required to take effect my memory and cause difficulties in management. Winz are no help either. They simply send me away and because I am an ACC client and do not want to provide any support. My self esteem and confidence has been affected  and I feel like  I am burden to my friends and family. My close relationships suffer and at times my will to live has even been a struggle to maintain. Please let me know what your thoughts are and what I need to do to approach ACC to hopefully successfully gain an increase in my wages where I can live a life where I am not reliant.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nJacob Spooner"
