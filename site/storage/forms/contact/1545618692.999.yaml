message: "Hi. I have not been declined as yet but will have trouble getting more evidence for them to accept my claim. I am at a loss of what to do next. have already been back to GP to get ACC to extend there 14 day limit as from 21/12/2018 till 07/01/2019. Very unfair move from ACC to put me and my family through this stress at this time of year.\r\nAny help you can offer would be gratefully received.\r\nKind regards\r\nRiki Alexander"
