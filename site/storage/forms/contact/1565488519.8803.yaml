message: 'Hey Warren, its Judith from Dunedin.  Wasn''t sure if your fosterandassociates@gmail email address was still active or not so thought I would contact you this way.  Could you give me a quick ring??  My turn to get sharfted by ACC.  When I mentioned your name as someone I knew - they basically sniggered and said you ''weren''t dealing with cases now''...I think an email from you asking for my file might give them a ''wake up call''.   Had my accident 15/9/18 and just want a blood knee operation.  Still getting some ACC assistance with hours as not back full time.  Still got concussion but that''s another story.  I would really appreciate a call Warren and hope life is treating you well in ?Nelson (I heard..)  cheers, Jude'
