message: "If your company would like another current case for preparing a class action against ACC involving multiple Review Numbers and multiple injuries and entitlements,  then contact me.  I am also available to help others search precedent Appeal cases.\r\nMatters under s40 are a big part of the ACC failings. \r\nI believe that ACC is beyond redemption and Sir Jeffery Palmer is right. It needs to be shut down. \r\nAlternatively, as the Australian ACCC recommend, the Act needs to be amended to make it a criminal offence for ACC staff and management to breach the act resulting in their dismissal. E.g. Keith Campbell and his team of Review and Resolution Specialists, and Case managers."
