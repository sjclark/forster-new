message: "Hi Warren I recently read about the work you have done on ACC and your comment the system is broken. Absolutely right. We have been battling through the system for 41/2 years for my wife and it's got to the point where I am prepared to go political with it. To that end I have put in an official information request for some ACC statistics. I travel the top of the South island for work and deal with a lot of trades people. I am astounded by the number of people who have had to resort to legal representation to get the treatment that they are entitled to. On principle I will not go that route as I am prepared to fight for everybody as it seems are you. I offer you my support. The system we have now needs to change as its it hardly worth having the way it is currently operated.\r\nKind regards\r\nDave"
