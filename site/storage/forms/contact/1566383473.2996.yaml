message: "I have just been declined financial compensation by ACC.\r\nI developed PTSD from the February 2011 aftershock whilst I was at work. ACC have agreed that this is so, the event, and I have their letter acknowledging that I got PTSD whilst at work. \r\nHowever, the ACC legislation takes the date you first sought treatment as the date of the mental injury.  This is the date that I first contacted my doctor, October 2012, but this is an arbitrary date that I,  the ill person, inadvertently determined by going to the doctor myself.\r\nI didn&rsquo;t know I had PTSD, how do you know? PTSD requires a medical diagnosis, so the only way to know for sure if you have PTSD is to talk to a mental health care provider.\r\n \r\nMy PTSD developed over time, progressively getting worse until the point I couldn&rsquo;t work and was so ill my family forced me to go to the doctor. It is well known and documented that there can be a delay of months or even years between the event and the onset of PTSD.\r\nI had PTSD and didn&rsquo;t know it, I found it difficult to explain or understand what was happening to me and how hard it was for me to function. Nobody helped me at this interim time or even understood what was going on, how could they, they are not health experts, how is anyone supposed to know or deal with mental illness? \r\n \r\nI eventually did seek medical help in October 2012, as my life had deteriorated to such an extent that I was unable to cope, work, sleep, or function normally, apparently now I wasn&rsquo;t covered. Even though I had paid my levies all the time I was working. How can ACC say I got PTSD at work but then not cover me just because I happened to realise too late that there was something wrong with me?\r\n \r\nIt was a huge relief to me to finally get diagnosed and put on medication and to have counseling. It&rsquo;s been a long, hard and tortuous road that I have travelled on. I need financial help to become independent again after my mental injury, yet I am being penalised by a narrow interpretation of a legal clause that saves ACC money. This is not the spirit of the Act. I can clearly show when I ceased being able to work as I had to resign from my full-time job. Whilst ill but undiagnosed I spent all my savings and assets trying to support myself as I couldn&rsquo;t work. My decision-making was obviously affected by my mental illness.\r\n \r\nThe effects of my PTSD have been so far-reaching and debilitating. It has had a huge negative impact on my mental health, physical health, work, home, and relationships. I&rsquo;ve felt very isolated, haven&rsquo;t been able to maintain a job or trust other people. I tried to cope and be independent myself as there is still a huge stigma in NZ about not coping and asking for help.\r\n \r\nI feel that I am being discriminated against because of the very nature of my illness."
