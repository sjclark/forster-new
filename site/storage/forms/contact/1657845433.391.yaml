message: 'Hi, we are still involved in a 5 year battle for our son over traumatic brain injuries. We won at the appeal stage for cover but now ACC are trying to end his entitlements and push him down the mental illness route. We recently had a leading neuro-psychiatrist assess him and he emphatically stated that our sons issues are long lasting TBI issues. ACC refuse to accept this. Can you call us for a chat? Many thanks.'
