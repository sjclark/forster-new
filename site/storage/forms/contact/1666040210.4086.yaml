message: "Kia Ora,\r\nI really appreciated your insight the panel discussion on the proposed accessibility bill last night. I am a disabled student advocate and I have an opportunity to meet with the minister for disability next month. I will be discussing my advocacy for more accessible digital media and the creation of a legal captioning standard. However, I also want to discuss my disappointment with the proposed accessibility bill as a whole. Do you have any advice in regards to this? I am new to advocacy and not na&iuml;ve enough to think that I am an expert on the bill or accessibility advocacy. On another note, would it be possible to raise our lack of accessibility laws as discrimination on the grounds of disability and take the government to court under the Human Rights Act in order to enforce the creation of a better law?\r\nThank you for your time,\r\nHope Cotton (she/her)"
