message: "Kia ora Warren, I listened to you interview with Susie Ferguson on 9-noon.\r\nI am  Specialist Musculoskeletal Physician having worked in Dunedin and now Te Anau in this specialty for the last 22  yrs, I have ~9 month waiting list for new patients who come from all over the lower South Island. I provide accurate comprehensive clinical assessment, investigations including high tech radiology, I treat all patients comprehensively, using a wide range of therapies, Manual therapy DNS, myofascial release joint mobilization, joint and appropriate soft tissue injection and I supervise the rehabilitation restoring functional motor patterns reducing pain and disability return to sport and work. I have been heavily involved in Sports Medicine including national / international teams and athletes. I am trained to advanced level through the Prague School of rehabilitation Czech Rep under Prof Pavel Kolar, I believe the only NZer to have done this \r\n training. I work long hours 60-70 hrs a week mostly with ACC patients but I see a huge number of ACC failed and ACC declined patients who have major problems, whose life is a mess as a result and need a lot of help and with highly trained Practitioners and comprehensive management and rehabilitation. ACC has been broken for decades with incompetent ministers, managers decision makers and failed assessment processes and failed rehabilitation programs. I agree with you having a scheme for injury / accident only is a failure, fraught with problems. \r\nThe Health system is in chaos and crisis at present and the government  has introduced Health NZ which appears to have no clear structure or mission. It has not included a review of ACC. \r\nIn my opinion the huge amount of money gathered by ACC in levies and investments (they have never invested in rehabilitation) could help the current situation if ACC was converted to a general health insurance scheme. For all medical problems and benefitting all NZers.  (Not just this with disability). I dont know how much input you have had from Medical Practitioners but you need a lot of input from from suitably qualified experienced Medical Practitioners in planning a revised scheme. I am happy to help and contribute.      \r\nDr Steve Bentley  Musculoskeletal Physician.
