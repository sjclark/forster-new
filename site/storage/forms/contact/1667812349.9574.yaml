message: "Kia ora Warren, \r\n\r\nMy name is Alice Mander and we've met in my capacity as co-President of the National Disabled Students' Association. \r\n\r\nOn the weekend of the 18th we are hosting a hui in Wellington with some of our members from around Aotearoa. It is an opportunity for current and potential disabled learner leaders to get together, undergo training, and plan for 2023. Between 1.30-2.30 on Saturday the 19th of November we are hosting a panel on advocacy and campaigning. \r\n\r\nI was wondering whether you would be interested, and have the capacity, in being on this panel? We think that you would bring incredible insight, especially from a legal perspective and with experience in campaigning in the legislative space. It will be at Rutherford House, Victoria University (down by the law school). \r\n\r\nLook forward to hearing from you,\r\nAlice Mander"
