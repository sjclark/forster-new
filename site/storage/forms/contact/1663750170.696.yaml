message: "Hi Warren,\r\nI'm writing, with permission, on behalf of my son Nic. Nic had a bike accident at age 13 (he is now 22) this broke his radial head into 3 pieces. He has had 4 surgeries since and now has a disabled elbow. Nics NZ elbow specialist (Nics surgeon Craig Ball is the NZ expert) has identified a &quot;salvage&quot; operation which is not great. We have identified the possibility of a 3D printed custom radial head which could give a close to normal elbow function. Catch is the surgeon is USA based. ACC have told us that we need his NZ surgeon to indicate that the operation is not available here. Nic's surgeon is not going to have a problem saying that but he may not agree that the 3D option is possible or risk free. Its very new.  Craig is also the ACC reviewer on this sort of case. Question is -is this a conflict of interest and what happens in this situation? Would ACC accept an overseas opinion.  Are they even likely to approve a new and possibly risky USA operation?\r\n\r\nSorry for very wordy email. Long story short I want Nic and I to be a bit better prepared before we push Craig into a corner. Its going to be very difficult to do this without the ACC funding.\r\n\r\nIf Nic and I could discuss this on the phone for a short time or if you could recommend someone we could discuss our situation with that would be great.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nPhil &amp; Nic Brownlie"
