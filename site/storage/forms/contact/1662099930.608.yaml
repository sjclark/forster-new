message: "Good afternoon Mr Forster,\r\nI am a journalist writing for Safeguard magazine, an occupational health and safety publication based in Auckland.\r\nIn the next issue of our Safeguard Update newsletter I will be writing about your Removing Disabling Experiences report and would like to ask you a few questions about your research, particularly as it relates to those in the workforce, before I do so. \r\nWould you be available for a brief (15-20 minute) phone interview  before COB on Wednesday (Sept 7)? I am happy to schedule this for out of office hours if that suits you better.\r\nPlease let me know if you will be available. You can contact me on 0212940063 if you need any more information.\r\nThanks. Look forward to hearing from you.\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nJackie Brown-Haysom\r\nContributing writer\r\nSafeguard \r\nwww.safeguard.co.nz"
