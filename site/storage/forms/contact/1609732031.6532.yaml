message: "G&rsquo;day\r\n \r\nI got injured in September 2019 and eventually needed time off after lockdown as without treatment my injury got worse but ACC declined my request for wage compensation so I had to spend all my savings to get by till I was able to go back to work.\r\nSince then I been struggling to challenge ACC&rsquo;s decision and they asked their hired nurses to dispute even the surgeon who examined my MRI scans - which is how I found your firm, as I was researching how absurd it is that they are allowed to hire nurses and physiotherapists to refute reports from doctors and surgeons.\r\nAnyway I tried to send an email to info@forster.co.nz with some attached documents to help you understand the situation but it returned. Please let me know if you can help me.\r\nThank you and happy 2021.\r\n \r\nBest regards,\r\nCarlos Ferrari\r\nMobile: +64 027 373 4863"
