message: "Can you help?\r\n\r\nI am not currently looking for legal representation. I am representing myself at this stage. If matters go to the appeal court then that will change.\r\n\r\nl am currently looking for legal advice on weekly entitlements, and a recalculation of my weekly entitlements by a weekly entitlements legal expert as I do not believe them to be have been accurate.\r\n\r\nA do not Trust ACC to get it right but they have decided to look at it again when at our First Conciliation meeting today.  My accident is dated 13 November, 2016.\r\n\r\nMy second Conciliation meeting  with Fairways Resolution is planned for February 10 at which time I need this recalculated and explained by you, and ready to present to ACC to counter their own recalc.\r\n\r\nI cannot find a category in the Act which covers my kind of employment so think that Precedents may be the method. Review # 6517630.\r\n\r\nI have two sources of employment, one is a low paid orchard work (on which entitlements are currently calculated) which keep me busy when not doing high paid engineering contracting work.\r\n\r\nBoth employments use the same GST registered Partnership business entity (owned by my wife and I) , and my personal income tax return is extracted from that.\r\n\r\nContracts last at least 3 months and happen ever 1-2 years. Late 2018 I failed a return to contract work trial after 11 weeks due to injuries, so ACC returned me to the old low entitlement rate, and\r\n\r\nearly 2019  I had to turn down another offer of contract work which would have lasted over 12 months. ACC ceased entitlements September 2019, which triggered a number of review numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have a weekly entitlements expert who can help in the required time frame?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nEric Nelson\r\n\r\n027 378 4990"
