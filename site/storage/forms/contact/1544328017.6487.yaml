message: "I contacted NZ Law Foundation and spoke to Dianne Gallagher 29th Nov 2018.\r\nWe spoke briefly in relation to the difficulties I have had with ACC regards double knee surgery that I need.\r\nI approached ACC 2yrs ago and got nowhere.\r\nI then went to Public Health and was put on the waiting list at an Otago Hospital, for an operation pending.\r\nAfter many months of waiting  we were shocked when the surgeon contacted us and told us that he would not do the surgery.    This was near \r\n the time the surgery was due to be done.\r\nBoth the Doctor and the surgeon did not tell us why the surgery was not going to be done.\r\nAfter some time and a new Doctor,  along with requesting my medical file we found out the reason for non surgery.\r\nThe reason given was that &quot;my expectations of the surgery were too high!&quot; \r\nI was being positive in the outcome, but being realistic at the same time that nothing is a given.\r\nI get $152 a wk on a disable benefit,  my wife and I pay up to $3000 pr month on interest,  mortgage,  overdraft and visas.\r\nOur property is for sale and is yet to sell.\r\nWe have assets up for sale.\r\nWe have managed to pay the bank payments-  just.\r\nWe have had some loyal friends helping us out ,  my wife is retired and I am on this small benefit.\r\nIts cat and mouse each month,  and the future is uncertain.\r\nBoth of us have worked hard for what we own.   One should not have to sell their home to survive.\r\nACC have not treated us well.\r\nWe have kept a well documented file.   \r\nAre we able to send my file for you to look at?\r\nIf so supply an address.\r\n Question:\r\nHow do you charge in cases like this?\r\nLook forward to your reply and help.\r\nThank You\r\nAshley Briggs"
