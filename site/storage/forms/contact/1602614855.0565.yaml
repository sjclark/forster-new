ACC lied about injuries ( and still criminally omit  status and severity) .\r\nThe CCDHB( and ACC) refused Valerie both urgent care  and primary care services( a still  unaddressed  HRC complaint was made in 2007).\r\nValerie  was unsafely discharged 2 weeks after the accident, transferred to ACC for &quot;active rehab&quot;( kidnapped on 13/4/6)  while  in an (undisclosed) clinically unstable  severely injured condition. ACC put her in Cavit ABI lockup, daily tortured her,molested,lied about the injuries severity and status ,  a nurse also tried to murder her , there was  no daily specialist  input ,  I  brought her home on 9/5/6 and tried to get her readmitted the  next day at CCDHB but they would not admit her .We were forced to mediate with ACC and CCDHB in 2006 which was ineffective with no needs, legal entltlements  proffered.  ACC still claimed they could case manage clinically unstable and severely injured disabled people in the hospital environment(they had/have  been criminally case managing our claims   since 4/4/6 coverage date).\r\n\r\nHer  Gp( who did not refer her to any needed inpatient specialist care /palliative care or provide us with any needs or help)  fired her in 2007 without transfer of care,  we saw many Gps in 2007 but did not get any pain management/ needs/help/referrals  from them either they told her she was just  &quot; intolerant to pain&quot; when they tortured her. This &quot;wrong treatment and CCDHB misdiagnoses and non disclosure  cause  many further injuries  inc chronic pain and regional pain syndrome.\r\nACC forced  assessed in 2006 (said it was needed  for an IRP )for over 12 weeks and refused to fund injury care( +treatments ) and plan for provide an  IRP we have no relationship with ACC following their criminal acts and omissions.ACC did not provide us with access to any  legal entitlements, IRP  and did not help or support us .\r\nThe matters and issues of  urgent and serious  complaints are unaddressed.\r\n\r\nJustice denied in 2007.\r\nIn 2007 after unsuccessful mediation and meeting processes we appealed ACCs criminal actions, ending the relationship, breaching contract and Statutory failures on the advice of  Crown ACC Minister and the Courts denied us access to justice adjourning our three &quot; complex and urgent&quot; High Court  appeals sin die in lower court with no needed legal remedies, no assistance, no payment for hours of work done, injury costs  and no support.\r\nJML were asked for help but then  misrepresented Valerie and I,  as he assigned to us  an undisclosed treatment injury provider (the  CCDHB prosecutor) employee Helen demontalk who had a clear conflict of interest endangered and hurt  Valerie and failed to proffer or provide any needs and/or  legal entitlements.\r\n\r\nThe Crown's ombudsman office is still unresponsive .\r\n\r\n\r\nWe applied for our full and correct entitlements from MSD in 2007 but  the MSD would not provide them or give us a fair and timely review.\r\nIn 2009 they stopped a very small &quot;non reviewable&quot; disability allowance ($30 week).\r\nThen in  2016 the MSD stopped only income her( and my) invalid benefit when nothing happened and there was no change in our exceptional circumstances and situation.\r\nCruel Punishment.Valerie ( terrified of Crown registered Drs and practitioners) refused under NZBORA and HRA to see another  state licensed and  state reg med practitioner for another MSD  med cert the last one they had was in 2007 and they did not use the private info from 2007 &quot; terminal&quot; &quot;permanent&quot;  to  fund  injury care,  high special needs( payment for hours of  work done MOH ) ,treatment,access,  home  modifications,transport,needed   equipment etc. The msd 2016 med cert was unprescribed by any dr  as her Dr CCDHB PHO  fired her in 2007 without transfer of care.\r\n\r\nThe MSD wanted and seem to still want to force  her to see a  treatment injury provider( CCDHB) psychologist/GP  for an examination of her lifetime serious injuries , very serious untreated and multiple  complex injuries and medical conditions.\r\nThe MSD   CE recommended med treatment  is  &quot;wrong treatment&quot; that the med  practitioner they say we should see for a med cert  the injuries lack scope of practice to examine the complex severe injuries( *which were never  even treated/examined in the  first place). That Valerie has a right to refuse this as it is medical treatment (and it is unsafe inappropriate &amp; wrong).\r\nThe  Crown MSD have all the private med info they  needed as they forced us to provide 2 med certs in 2007   for eligibility  for (provision of  injury care, treatments, equipment, mobility, modifications, transport,  high special needs which they then  did not proffer or  fund) our eligibility for assistance and support  was established in 2007 .We make weekly correspondence and the MSD are unresponsive inhuman they lied to ombudsman office that we did not contact them.\r\n\r\nWe currently still  have no support or assistance and no access to legal entitlements through  Crown's  ACC or Crown's  MSD/MOH.\r\n\r\nAny advice or help would be greatly  appreciated as we still have no access to any support or assistance.\r\n\r\nBarry Metin and Valerie Metin"
