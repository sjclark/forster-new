message: 'Please help, I was left disabled following back surgery for a bulging disc, acc accepted treatment claim and mental injury claim and provided wheel chair and house mods however they claim I am only 5% impaired and therefore not entitled to comp, I have lost my career and business unable to work getting weekly comp but severely less than I used to earn.  How can I loose everything be assessed by specialists but have acc say I''m not entitled?  They have tried to have me re assessed by doctors who are not qualified or in one instance banned from practicing one is even an OC with a skin care company!  Fairway appointed but they tell me they are not mediators just simply to check ACC followed process not the outcome. Happy to share all files but need help as its killing me having to fight every day'
