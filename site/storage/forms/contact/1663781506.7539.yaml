message: "Hi Warren,\r\nI'm a journalist with Safeguard magazine. We spoke a couple of weeks back about the Removing Disabling Experiences report. \r\nI've now written a piece for the magazine based on that interview and would be grateful if you could take a quick look to ensure there are no factual errors. Time is very short - we go to press next week - but if you could possibly give me an email address I would be happy to send the text through to you today.\r\nThanks,\r\nRegards,\r\nJackie Brown-Haysom"
