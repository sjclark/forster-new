message: "Hi, \r\n\r\nI understand you are not looking at any additional individual cases at this time, though when you do I am hoping for your opinion on a matter.\r\n\r\nI am enquiring to see if I am eligible to compensation of any kind for injuries I suffered in a car accident in 1990. \r\n\r\nI am a NZ citizen though I now reside in Australia. At 16 years of age I was a passenger in a head-on car accident in Otago, found to be the fault of the other driver, in which I received significant leg injuries (broken femur, dislocated hip). \r\n\r\nUntil recent years these injuries have been manageable and have had a relatively small impact on my life. However, over the last 3-4 years the impact of the injuries on my day to day life are becoming more significant, to the point where I now experience a daily reminder in the form of pain and discomfort of one kind or another which can be directly attributed to this accident. \r\n\r\nI look forward to your response.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nChris"
