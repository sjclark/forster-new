message: "Hello \r\n\r\nI am challenging ACC on an injury claim. It is a complicated New Zealand first claim and there is very little case law pertaining to it. It has been through mediation and review with outcomes that are flawed with decisions that the reviewer made clearly incorrect. I have ample evidence to prove this. I have contacted the follow firms who are too busy at the moment to take on this complicated case.\r\nAndrew Cadenhead\r\nThomas Dewar ...\r\nHazel Armstrong\r\nJohn Miller Law\r\nI am living in Christchurch on a disability benefit as a consequence of the injury and therefore need for legal aid or billed on a successful. Do you have to capacity to take on this case? Do you know any legal firms that may be available?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nRoland Matthews"
