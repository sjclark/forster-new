message: "Predictably, ACC employed a crooked doctor to assess me for the Independence Allowance, which ACC has withheld from me for 9 years.\r\n\r\nMy question now is what can I do now?  This report is not just insulting and minimizing me, it is the basis for which ACC, if they deem to, will pay me on the Independence Allowance.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be no point in itemizing all the mistakes, which are glaring, because ACC will not change it.  Although my Case Manager said he will send the results of recent MRI x 2 and SPECT scan to the Assessor, I doubt if that will happen either, because the CM won't do anything I ask him to.\r\n\r\nCan I go to Court about it, or do I just have to refute the report and wait until next year?\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing if there's anything I can do.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nGlenys Fazio"
