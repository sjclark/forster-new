message: "Hi \r\n\r\nI am really needing help as my x2 claims are getting nowhere &amp; i have been getting the run around for a few years now. I have a workplace back injury claim &amp; also a sensitive claim to deal with, i have cover for the SC but they are refusing WC. They disentitled my back injury so I no longer have cover for that due to a non treating specialist report (unseen) back in 2016, i have since been to a specialist in Auckland who is not only my 'treating' specialist but he did more in depth investigations on my injury &amp; ACC are ignoring his reports. I do not know where to turn now &amp; my advocate has her own problems she is dealing with. \r\nBest way to contact me is via email unless i have a set time to call as my PTSD effects my answering the phone.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read my email.\r\n\r\nNiki"
