message: 'Kia ora, I am interested in your research regarding the extension of ACC, well done on getting the survey up and running it''s great. I have a policy interest in this (and am involved in the NZ Labour Party), and wondered if you have come across any cost projections for this? If so, would you be willing to point us in the right direction? Our local policy committee are looking to further the public conversation about extending ACC to cover illness and disability, and I think a cost projection would be very useful. Very happy to have a conversation too. NgƒÅ mihi, Sarah'
