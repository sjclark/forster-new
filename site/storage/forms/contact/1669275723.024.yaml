message: "Kia ora Warren. \r\n\r\nI'm writing from a small NZ charity working with a massive issue affecting 1-in-9 women and teen girls and those assigned female at birth. We've been around for more than 20 years providing support and information to empower these 1-in-9. We've recently embraced a new strategy which aims to direct some of our efforts to influencing changes to the broken the health system to improve some massive equity issues. Endometriosis has massive impacts on quality of life, relationships, fertility, education and the ability to earn. Yet it is difficult to get traction on a long-term condition which is easily dismissed, not due to an accident nor lifestyle, isn't life-threatening, isn't legally considered a disability..... and affects women. I cannot help but think that a comparable condition affecting 1-in-9 men and which normalised castration would have gotten a whole lot more interest by now.\r\n\r\nWe're tired of helping people navigate a broken system. We have some sound evidence-based principles on which to base changes, but no pathway to get anything implemented.\r\n\r\nI'm re-listening to your RNZ talk a few months ago and marveling at your success in getting some traction with ACC's systemic issues - which I'm certain didn't happen overnight!! It fascinates me that the majority of successful claimants are men - while women, Maori, Pasifika and the disabled have struggled to get access - but I'm not surprised.\r\n\r\nI wonder if you would you have half-an-hour for a zoom sometime to share your wisdom and insight into how we might progress our advocacy. Any time you can spare would be very appreciated :).\r\n\r\nLook forward to hearing back, thanks\r\n\r\nNgaa mihi\r\n\r\n\r\n- Annette Evans, Manager/Educator, Insight Endometriosis Charitable Trust (based in Hamilton).\r\n  Phone/Text 0225855123"
