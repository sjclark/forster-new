message: "Hi Team,\r\nI have a client (previously worked with Warren) who needs advice fighting an assessment request from ACC with no choice of assessor.  He has been given a day and time and assessor but ACC wont send a copy of the referral or a list of assessors to choose from despite multiple requests from him and myself.  He also previously had assessment recommendations from Gil Newburn and an ACC psychologist for rehabilitation that didn't materialize into actual rehab.  The concern is that not attending the assessment is not an option however attending the assessment without knowing what it is for could be equally as detrimental for someone on a long term ACC compensation.\r\n\r\nThis client has a long history with ACC including multiple reviews and complaints.  It is out of my depth and I am concerned about the stress impacts on him.\r\n\r\nAre you able to give me some advice around helping him? Wording communications with his case manager etc?"
