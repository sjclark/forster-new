message: "Condidential, otherwise privileged, and urgent.\r\n    I am a lawyer in Nelson acting for a Galina Couvee. She needs two  opinions after the High Court struck out all of her causes of action in tort for staff negligence or worse over many years, arguably in part due to a defective statement of claim.  The opinion needs to come quickly but can be paid for. As the SOC drafter was me, there is now a conflict of interest. She has final name suppression but costs arguments, appeal and a JR are live. She need s to decide \r\n1. whether to continue with the drafter of the impugned  SOC (me); and\r\n2. Whether you might be prepared to take over her case. She had Legal Aid for all three matters\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\nRob Ord"
