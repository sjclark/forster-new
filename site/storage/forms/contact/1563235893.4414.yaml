message: "Good afternoon,\r\nI am a law student in my fourth year of university at Victoria. I am passionate about advocating for people with disabilities. \r\nI was wondering if there is anyone who might be able to give me some guidance on how to get involved in this area or if your firm ever had an opportunities for a law clerk or someone soon to graduate? \r\nNga mihi \r\nLaura"
