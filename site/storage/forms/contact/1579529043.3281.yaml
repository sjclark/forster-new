message: "Thousands of domain names expire every day. \r\n\r\nThe reasons are different - Some owners forgot to renew the domains, some just don't want them anymore or they moved on to other projects. For most people these so called Expired Domains don't have any value. They just see a bunch of Domain Names someone else deleted and move on, but for the people who know about SEO or the value of good Backlinks, Expired Domain Names are money just waiting to get picked up from the street.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning behind purchasing an expired domain is that it will still have all of its previous ranking power and SEO value, which can be used in several ways.For example, a domain that has been around for a decade and has many backlinks will usually have a lot of link juice that can be utilized.  Use this domain as your new site and you will benefit from the existing SEO value giving you a much needed headstart in the SEO game.\r\n\r\nCheck out our unique list of domains with high quality backlinks: http://bit.ly/expired-domain-name-seo-lists\r\n\r\nBridget"
