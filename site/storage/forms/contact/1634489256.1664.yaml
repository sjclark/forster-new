message: "Hi Forster team.\r\nI have been on ACC for three years now and have recently lost a review for a work related injury, at around the same time I requested a review for a work place gradual process claim that was declined right at the start. This review request has been granted for review with the reviewer from the case just lost, suggesting that with the evidence I have brought forward I should apply for this WPGP claim review and suggested ACC also look at this declined WPGP claim.\r\n\r\nAbout my injury, I have cervical ridiculopothy and spondilosis with osteophites. I have a few Dr reviews with the correct names and spelling.\r\n\r\nWork history, I have been in the engineering industry sense I was 16 years old and had a welding halmet on my head for more than half of my working career. Apart from 3 - 4 years that I was in the meat works industry.\r\n\r\nI found some relatively new studies connecting welding or welders to this type of injury. Some of these studies can be found in the JOSE journals and on research gate. I have the links to abstracts and have requested where I can for the full article. I am now kind of a little lost as where to go from here and what to do with all the information I have found.\r\n\r\nI would love to talk with someone please that can help me with getting all the info together and see this through. After 3 years of dealing with this I am running low on keeping my opinion to myself.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\nRiki Alexander"
