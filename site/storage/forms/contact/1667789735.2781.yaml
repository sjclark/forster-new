message: "Hi Warren - I've made a copule of submissions recently using your reports - one on the Accessibility Bill and one on ACC's Accredited Employers Scheme. I don't expect either submission to make the slightest difference to the government's plans, of course, but I though your reports were excellent.\r\nKind regards\r\nMichael Gibson"
