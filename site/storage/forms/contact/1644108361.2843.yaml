message: "Hi Warren, and thank you for all your fantastic work.\r\n\r\nI emailed earlier.  Talk, meet, resolve handled a review about 3 years ago in Nelson for me.   It was so different to that of the Fairview lawyer.\r\n\r\n ACC has been withholding the Independence Allowance from me for 9 years.  Now I have had the Assessment, and the report is, of course, omissions, inaccuracies, and minimizations of my conditions.\r\n\r\nCan I get your team to conduct the review and is there anything I should know before requesting it from my Case Manager?\r\n\r\nThanks so much and I appreciate your support.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nGlenys Fazio"
