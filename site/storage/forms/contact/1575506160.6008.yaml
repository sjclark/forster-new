message: "Hello Warren,\r\nSome weeks previous I enquired as to whether exemplary damages and compensation damages could be obtained at the same time. From my research I understand they can. \r\nI am covered for personal injury by accident and receive 80% of the minimum wage. \r\nMy claim for exemplary damages for gross negligence was struck out for being time barred. This is despite filing and serving my court documents 2 months after finding out what I did from reading my medical records.\r\nWithout elaborating, I followed a process against ACC which I had been informed by lawyers was my only option. Within 3 years I served my court documents in the High Court, against the Crown, whom I was later informed was the correct defendant. I am puzzled by this as the Adlam case was against ACC and not the Crown.?Maybe my case is similar to the historical Lake Alice cases which were against the Crown?\r\nI believe I was given the run-around. Needless to say, my question to you is in relation to your statement that 'by not issuing formal delegations and not having people legally authorised then the claimant could win the case...'\r\nFurther to the above, you maintain that 'everyone who had a review hearing, where the reviewer had not been legally appointed, was deemed to have the decision in their favour and won.'\r\nDuring the review hearing I brought up the potential  conflict of interest issue when I questioned Rex Woodhouse's impartiality after he divulged he had worked with ACC. As a consequence I requested the hearing to be part heard. I was not aware of what else I could do?\r\nThough I do recall and this is noted in the transcript, that Rex had advised me to go to the Health and Disability Commissioner to seek redress. At no time was I informed it was the Crown I should be seeking redress with.\r\nIn a nutshell, I would be interested in working with you. Shall I send you my court documents?\r\nBest wishes\r\nTania"
