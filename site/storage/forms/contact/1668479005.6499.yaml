message: "Kia ora Warren,\r\n\r\nI'm Kristie, I'm a reporter for Stuff/The Press looking into a story on CRPS. I know you have worked with people in the past in regards to ACC claims of this. I also saw you had spoken with a reporter for Stuff in the past.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if you are free for a phone call chat with me tomorrow? Or I can send through some questions via email if that's better. Either way it would be great to hear your thoughts and expertise.\r\n\r\nHope to hear from you soon, \r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nKristie"
