media_blurb: "A national ''Disability Matters'' conference aims to make the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities an everyday reality in New Zealand. Dunedin lawyer and ACC researcher Warren Forster made that point in Dunedin yesterday on the first main day of the conference. For many people in New Zealand, ''human rights under the convention are more of a nice idea than an everyday thing'', Mr Forster said."
