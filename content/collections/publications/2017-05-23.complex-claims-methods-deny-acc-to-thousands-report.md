media_blurb: "Up to 300,000 people a year could be missing out on ACC cover, treatment or support, the lead author of a new report has estimated. That's more than four times ACC's own estimates and it has prompted the report's authors to call for an independent commissioner to oversee the system, make it more transparent and keep better data. They also want to see a change in the way ACC determines how an injury was caused."
