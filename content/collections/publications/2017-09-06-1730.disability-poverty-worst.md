media_blurb: "... Candidates were asked about ACC reform by Acclaim Otago, a support group whose report prompted action from the Government to look at ways to improve the corporation. Mr Gregory said ACC was a ''big beast'' and the Government was open to ideas. He promised to talk to the report researcher Warren Forster, who was in the audience. ''Sounds like he's the guy for me to talk to afterwards,'' Mr Gregory said."
