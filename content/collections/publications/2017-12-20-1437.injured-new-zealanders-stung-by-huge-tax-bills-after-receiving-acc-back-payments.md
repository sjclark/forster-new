media_blurb: "Almost 300 injured New Zealanders were stung by huge tax bills last year after receiving hefty back-payments from ACC - an issue which has been repeatedly brought to the Government's attention for more than a decade. Hundreds of Kiwis receive back-payments from ACC each year either because they lodged a late claim, because they won a case for compensation which ACC had previously refused, there were re-calculations or because complex claims required a lot of investigation to determine cover."
