media_blurb: "A Dunedin barrister says there's no way to hold ACC's Remote Claims Unit to account when its staff members use fake names. The use of pseudonyms by staff fearful of client abuse has come to light at the Ministry of Social Development. Now ACC admits its staff also use pseudonyms. Dunedin lawyer and ACC researcher Warren Forster tells us it's too hard for people to build relationships with their case managers when fake names are used."
