media_blurb: 'Hundreds of thousands of injured Kiwis are declined cover each year by ACC, causing "unacceptable harm" to many legitimate claimants, according to new research. Injured people who have been denied cover "find themselves pitted against a huge, billion-dollar specialist Crown agency", the Law Foundation and University of Otago-backed report said. The report, published on Tuesday, calls for the establishment of a personal injury commissioner to help people navigate the Accident Compensation Corporation''s (ACC) "incredibly complex and difficult" complaints process.'
