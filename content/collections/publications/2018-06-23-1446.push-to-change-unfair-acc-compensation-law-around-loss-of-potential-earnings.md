media_blurb: 'The Government is being urged to honour a pre-election promise to change an "unfair" law which sees some working people injured in accidents getting less than minimum wage while receiving follow-up medical care. Currently, ACC pays people who are hurt in accidents while they are employed 80 per cent of their previous year''s income while they''re off work for treatment and rehabilitation. But those who are injured while they aren''t working - including people injured as children - are only entitled to "loss of potential income" payments of 80 per cent of minimum wage if they need follow-up treatment, even after they start working.'
