People are the heart of our communities and our society in Aotearoa, New Zealand.  We recognise as a society that many people with impairments have disabling experiences; these can result in exclusion, and we want to change that. We share a vision that in the future we will have an integrated person-directed system for supporting people with impairments that will reduce our disabling experiences. This future system will provide four enforceable rights to social and income support, habilitation, and healthcare. 

It will work with two complementary systems for improving accessibility and for removing discrimination and be coordinated by an organisation tasked with removing peoples' negative disabiling experiences.
