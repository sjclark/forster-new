title: "Making New Zealand Accessible"
subtitle: "A design for effective accessibility legislation"
introduction: "In a ground-breaking report from 2021 the research team of Warren Forster, Tom Barraclough and Curtis Barnes set out to design legislation that would be effective in identifying and removing barriers that cause disabling experiences for so many of our people. They recognise that this is a once in a generation opportunity for our law and policy makers to develop a regulatory system to bring about this change."

                Project lead, Warren Forster, says, “We tried to understand the
                United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,
                the ambitions of the Access Alliance and Te Tirirti o Waitangi to create
                a legislative framework that would work within New Zealand’s particular
                legal system. We recognise that we don’t have access to the
                information, expertise and resourcing available to government.

                “This report also aims to assist disabled people, political leaders,
                and future decision makers to understand how a system could be designed
                to provide accessible, equitable and effective change.”

                This report provides a starting point for co-designing the future
                accessibility system in a way that is most likely to remove known and
                emerging barriers faced by disabled people and others. It sets out the
                organisational structures that could be developed to create this. To
                make this system work, it will need disabled people, iwi groups,
                businesses, governments, and non-government organisations to collaborate
                to bring about this change.

                While some deviation from the key features incorporated in our system
                is inevitable, any deviations from the key features of the system as we
                have framed it should take into account the reasons we give for why the
                system should be designed in that way.

                The project team has set out the specifics of the system as much as
                they can and hope it is helpful for people wishing to develop
                legislation now and continue to be useful for future advocates of
                accessibility legislation for New Zealand. They have written a report
                that proposes a legal framework to make New Zealand accessible for and
                remove barriers that create disabling experiences. A quarter of New
                Zealanders experience disability, and everyone will have an impairment
                at some point.

                The report recommendations aim to get rid of disabling experiences,
                not get rid of disability. There is nothing wrong with disability or
                being disabled – disability can be a strong and positive part of
                someone’s identity.
